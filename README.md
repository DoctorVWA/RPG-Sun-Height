# RPG Sun Height
Simple website to generate time-based sun/moon altitude/azimuth images, for being used as a clock-like feature on tabletop RPGs.

# Libraries used
[Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/), [Moment timezone](https://momentjs.com/timezone/), [suncalc](https://github.com/mourner/suncalc) and [tz-lookup](https://github.com/darkskyapp/tz-lookup-oss)

# TODO
- [ ] Better sprites
- [ ] Moon phases
- [ ] Sky color

I'm open to ideas, just open an issue
